## 0xBUTT Trading Competition Airdrop

There are 3 main components to this trading competition. First component is the Airdrop, Second is the Trading competition, and Third are the rewards. If you are interested in only the Airdrop part, please read below, ButtCoin is going to be very strict and careful about this airdrop. It is always possible to cheat, but we will make it a bit harder this time.

### Main goal(s)

Our last airdrop was a big success, and this time, we will implement the same mechanisms to initiate the trading on a DDEX exchange. https://ddex.io/trade/0xBUTT-WETH

The main goal of this airdrop is to get the DDEX exchange's numbers moving. Listing a token on DDEX was not an easy procedure. It required a lot of patience and meeting the standards. However, it was only a beginning and now we are facing another big obstacle which involves increasing the 0xBUTT trade volume. Without it, the project will not succeed, since it is a requirement for many things such as listing on a CoinMarketcap. ButtCoin strongly believes that this step is the most important step which will determine the future of a token. Although our team has the right skills to create the trading bots, we don't believe that end justifies the means. As a meme-coin, the meme needs to be alive while using the bots simply doesn't feel alive.

ButtCoin strongly believes that in order to gain, we need to give first. Nevertheless, the numbers sometimes mean nothing. It is what is being done with this token that matters. We would like to give something physical to everyone who makes a trade and submits their mailing address to a designated protonmail.  We will not say what it will be, nevertheless, your location must not exceed $5 Canadian to get a simple mail and an envelope from the ButtCoin headquarters.

### Why the Protonmail ?
Protonmail is the best way to make sure that your infomration is encrypted, stays encrypted, and is not obtained by anyone else rather than ButtCoin. Furthermore, ButtCoin will make sure that any information that you provide is not used by anyone else other than ButtCoin and for no other purpose other than completing the Airdrop and a Trading Competition.

### What are the physical rewards ?
We are not going to say what the physical rewards are. It is going to be a collectible item, and perhaps one day, it will become worth much more than a ButtCoin. We are ready to send 30 rewards with the mail to any location that will not exceed $5 Canadian. Furthermore, the first, second and the third prices could cost up to $40 (Canadian) per reward and shipping/handling will be covered by the ButtCoin. If you are not sure about your location, please ask by sending an e-mail to info@0xbutt.com and we will confirm with the post-office. Please include your country/city and an ETH trading address.

### What are the token rewards ?
The first reward will be one million tokens, second and third will be 100,000 tokens.
This time, the rewards will not come from the community account but directly from a developers' account. This way, we will leave more tokens for the community.

### How are tokens going to be supplied for the competition ?
During the first third of a competition, any buy-order that is 0.000002 or greater will be filled by the ButtCoin. We will fill only 1000-2000 tokens per day. Tokens will be taken from a community account and any money that is earned will be spent on an airdrop. Announcements will be made regarding the start and an end of this period.

### How long is this trading competition going to be ?
It is going to be at least 3-times longer than the standard DDEX competition. Consider this a warm-up to a DDEX competition. Although requirement for a DDEX competition is to have a toal volume of 10 ETH, we can end the competition without fulfilling this requirement. We simply have to make sure that a normal trading will continue once the competition is done. The worst-case scenario is competition not getting more than 30 candidates and trading volume not increasing. In that case, the competition will not end until announced.

### When does the airdrop start and end, and when will the airdrop rewards be given (and how much) ?
The airdrop starts as soon as the announcement is made on a Twitter. The airdrop ends when at least 30 different (and registered) ETH addresses make a trade or when we reach the end of the first third of a competition time. We will give 150 tokens (burning applies).

### What are the requirements for this airdrop ?
1. RETWEET AND SAY NOTHING! Any retweets that contain things such as "good project", "nice", "will moon", and so on... will be considered a cheat. Do not write a single letter!

2. E-mail your Twitter @ account where we can see the retweet, as well as your ETH address. We will not accept e-mails that do not have these two together. Furthermore, please do not try to send duplicates it simply won't work.

3. You must retweet directly from our Twitter page (@0xbutt) and we must be able to see it listed on an original tweet and not someone else's re-tweet.

4. You can use any e-mail subject you want. If you think you made a mistake, just send another e-mail with the correct information.

Any mistakes would mean that there is either some automatization involved or that you have blindly retweeted without caring about this project.  Sorry, no tokens will be given under such circumstances. The only thing you can get is our deepest gratitude for a retweet. Furthermore, your ETH addresses will not be listed anywhere for a public to see. Everything will be kept private.

This is an example of what the e-mail should contain:

FROM: your@email.com
TO: 0xBUTT
SUBJECT: any_subject

0x615E3b6A61e8A5C9f3332752eF82517224857b32
@0xbutt

ANY OTHER FORMAT WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED! (However, you may put the twitter address first and then the ETH address).

If you have any questions, do not use 0xBUTT email address. Use info@0xbutt.com instead.
