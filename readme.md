## 0xBUTT Trading Competition Airdrop

There are 3 main components to this trading competition. First component is the Airdrop, Second is the Trading competition, and Third are the rewards. If you are interested in only the Airdrop part, please read below, ButtCoin is going to be very strict and careful about this airdrop. It is always possible to cheat, but we will make it a bit harder.

## Main goal(s)

Our last airdrop was a big success, and this time, we will implement the same mechanisms to initiate the trading on a DDEX exchange. https://ddex.io/trade/0xBUTT-WETH

The main goal of this airdrop is to get the DDEX exchange's numbers moving. Listing a token on DDEX was not an easy procedure. It required a lot of patience and meeting the standards. However, it was only a beginning and now we are facing another big obstacle which involves increasing the 0xBUTT trade volume. Without it, the project will not succeed, since it is a requirement for many things such as listing on a CoinMarketcap. ButtCoin strongly believes that this step is the most important step which will determine the future of a coin. Although our team has the right skills to create the trading bots, we don't believe that end justifies the means. As a meme-coin, the meme needs to be alive while using the bots is simply doesn't feel right.

ButtCoin strongly believes that in order to gain, we need to give first. Nevertheless, the numbers sometimes mean nothing. It is what is being done with this token that matters. We would like to give something physical to everyone who makes a trade and submits their mailing address to a designated protonmail.  We will not say what it will be, nevertheless, your location must not exceed $5 Canadian to get a simple mail and an envelope from the ButtCoin headquarters.

## Why protonmail ?
